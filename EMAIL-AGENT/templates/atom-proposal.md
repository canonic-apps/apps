Subject: CANONIC Partnership Options for ATOM Advantage

Avinash,

Great conversation. I put together a few options based on what we discussed.

THE PORTFOLIO

We've documented 159+ invention disclosures covering constitutional AI governance—from the core paradigm to healthcare-specific applications. The IP portfolio report is attached.

The CREDENTIALING-APP you saw is just the start. The governance framework applies across healthcare, insurance, and any regulated domain where AI decisions need to be traceable and auditable.

PARTNERSHIP OPTIONS

Option A: Pilot — $15K
4-week proof of concept. We credential 25 providers through governed workflows. You see the audit trail, governance enforcement, and compliance reporting in action. Low risk, fast validation.

Option B: Build Partnership — $150K
We build it for you. Full INSURANCE domain governance + your first production AI application. 16 weeks to market. You get governed AI without the learning curve.

Option C: Strategic Alliance — $75K + 5% revenue share
We co-develop the insurance governance vertical together. Joint IDFs, co-branded framework, you become the reference customer for insurance. Aligned incentives—we win when you win.

Option D: Enterprise License — $100K/year
Full platform access, unlimited usage, your team builds. Standard FRAND terms (10% on governed product revenue).

MY RECOMMENDATION

Start with the Pilot (A). $15K, 4 weeks, you see exactly what governed AI looks like on your providers. If it works, we graduate to the Alliance (C) for long-term partnership.

No pressure—just want to give you clear paths forward.

When can we sync this week?

Best,
Dexter
