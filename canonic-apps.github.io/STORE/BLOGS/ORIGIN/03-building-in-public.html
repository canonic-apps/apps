        <h1>Building in Public</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Why CANONIC is open source</p>
        <p class="meta">Markets: v0 (MACHINE Era) | ORIGIN/004</p>

        <h2>The Easy Path</h2>
        <p>We could have kept it closed.</p>
        <p>Seven years of development. Millions in funding. Clinical trials. Production deployments. Real evidence that it works.</p>
        <p>The conventional wisdom: protect everything. Patent it. License it. Build walls. Extract value.</p>
        <p>We chose different.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Why Open</h2>
        <p>Governance that hides defeats its purpose.</p>
        <p>If an AI system claims to follow rules, you should be able to read those rules. If a validator claims compliance, you should be able to run that validator. If a specification claims completeness, you should be able to test that specification.</p>
        <p>Trust requires transparency. Not as a slogan — as architecture.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What's Public</h2>
        <p>Everything that governs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CANON.md</strong> — The constitutional specification</li>
            <li><strong>Validators</strong> — The enforcement tools</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation</strong> — How to implement</li>
            <li><strong>Examples</strong> — Reference implementations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ledger. The evidence. The method.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What's Not</h2>
        <p>Some things remain private:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patient data (obviously)</li>
            <li>Active patent applications (until filed)</li>
            <li>Commercial partnerships (until announced)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But the governance layer itself? Open. Because that's the point.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Foundation Model</h2>
        <p>CANONIC Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Not because we're anti-business — we have commercial tiers and enterprise partnerships. But because the core protocol belongs to everyone.</p>
        <p>Like HTTP. Like TCP/IP. Like the protocols that built the internet.</p>
        <p>Governance infrastructure should be a public good.</p>
