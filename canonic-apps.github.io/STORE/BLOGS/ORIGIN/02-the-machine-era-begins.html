        <h1>The MACHINE Era Begins</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Why AI governance matters now</p>
        <p class="meta">Markets: v0 (MACHINE Era) | ORIGIN/003</p>

        <h2>The Old World</h2>
        <p>For decades, governance was human. Boards met quarterly. Lawyers drafted policies. Compliance officers filed reports. The speed of oversight matched the speed of business.</p>
        <p>That world is ending.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What Changed</h2>
        <p>Large language models read faster than any human. They generate content at scale. They make decisions in milliseconds. They operate 24/7, across time zones, without fatigue.</p>
        <p>The old governance model assumes you can review every decision. You can't. Not anymore.</p>
        <p>When an AI makes ten thousand decisions per hour, no compliance team keeps up. When models drift between versions, no quarterly review catches it. When prompts evolve through iteration, no policy manual stays current.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Triad</h2>
        <p>CANONIC proposes something different:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LLMs read</strong> governance documents</li>
            <li><strong>Humans review</strong> governance decisions</li>
            <li><strong>MACHINE enforces</strong> validated constraints</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No single party has complete authority. The LLM can't rewrite its own rules. The human can't override the machine's enforcement. The machine can't interpret beyond its specifications.</p>
        <p>Governance emerges from the intersection.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Why Now</h2>
        <p>2024 saw AI agents enter production. 2025 saw them fail. Not catastrophically—subtly. Drift. Inconsistency. Edge cases nobody predicted.</p>
        <p>2026 is the year of reckoning.</p>
        <p>Every company deploying AI will face the same question: How do you prove your system behaves as intended? Not once, but continuously. Not in the lab, but in production. Not to your engineers, but to regulators, customers, and the public.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The MACHINE Era</h2>
        <p>We call this v0 — the MACHINE era. The beginning.</p>
        <p>Future versions will emerge. Better validators. Richer specifications. More sophisticated enforcement. But the core insight won't change:</p>
        <blockquote>Governance that depends on human vigilance fails at machine speed. Governance that machines can read, enforce, and prove scales with the systems it governs.</blockquote>

        <hr>

        <h2>What Comes Next</h2>
        <p>CANONIC is open. The specifications are public. The validators are being built. The community is forming.</p>
        <p>If you're deploying AI and wondering how to govern it — you're not alone. If you're building systems that need to prove compliance — we're building for you. If you believe governance should be constitutional, not cosmetic — join us.</p>
        <p>The MACHINE era has begun.</p>
