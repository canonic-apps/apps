        <h1>Twenty Thousand Conversations</h1>

        <h2>Bloomberg Summit, 2017</h2>
        <p>New York City. I'm presenting "Breast We Can!" at the Bloomberg Data for Health Summit. Crowdsourced AI for breast cancer detection. The pitch is simple: patients are generating imaging data. That data could save lives. The system is broken.</p>
        <p>The room is full of healthcare executives and policy makers. Nobody's built this yet. The technology is emerging. The regulations are unclear. The opportunity is massive.</p>
        <p>UCF signs on. Western Digital provides storage infrastructure. NIH grants start flowing. $5M+ in funding over the next seven years. Clinical trials at UCSF.</p>
        <p>We call it MammoChat.</p>

        <h2>Casey DeSantis</h2>
        <p>2021. Florida's First Lady is diagnosed with breast cancer. She goes public with her journey. The state launches awareness campaigns. The conversation about early detection reaches millions.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, MammoChat is quietly logging its ten-thousandth patient conversation. Women across the country, navigating the same fear, the same uncertainty, the same gaps in communication that the healthcare system leaves unfilled.</p>
        <p>We're not competing with doctors. We're filling the silence between appointments.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Pattern</h2>
        <p>Twenty thousand conversations later, a pattern emerges.</p>
        <p>Patients don't need AI to replace their doctors. They need AI to fill the gaps. The 2 AM anxiety. The confusing paperwork. The silence that stretches between "we found something" and "here's what it means."</p>
        <p>Every conversation generates evidence. Every evidence point needs protection. Every protection needs rules.</p>
        <p>The rules accumulate. The rules need governance.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <p>From twenty thousand conversations:</p>
        <blockquote>Patients remember how they felt more than what they learned.</blockquote>
        <p>The information matters. The tone matters more. The consistency matters most.</p>
        <p>An AI that gives perfect information but varies wildly in approach breeds distrust. An AI that maintains steady presence, clear boundaries, and honest limitations earns something harder to measure: confidence.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Question</h2>
        <p>How do you ensure that consistency at scale?</p>
        <p>Not through training alone. Models change. Prompts drift. Teams rotate. The thing that seemed safe yesterday becomes problematic tomorrow.</p>
        <p>You need something that persists. Something the AI can read. Something humans can audit. Something that doesn't depend on who's watching.</p>
        <p>You need governance that governs itself.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>From Patients to Protocol</h2>
        <p>MammoChat didn't set out to build a governance framework. It set out to help scared women navigate a healthcare system that often fails them.</p>
        <p>But the conversations demanded it. Each edge case. Each moment where "what should I say?" became "what should <em>anyone</em> say in this situation, forever?"</p>
        <p>The patients taught us. Every constraint in CANONIC traces back to a real person, a real conversation, a real moment where we learned something couldn't be left to chance.</p>
