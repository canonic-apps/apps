# The Minimum Fixed Point

*How CANONIC regenerates from nothing*

---

**Markets:** v0 (MACHINE Era)
**Ledger:** TRANSCRIPTverse

---

## The Property

```
MINIMAL_FIXED_POINT = LANGUAGE + VALIDATORS
```

Given only these two things, everything regenerates.

---

## The Proof

Archive everything except LANGUAGE and VALIDATORS.

Then:

```
1. Regenerate CANONIC/ from LANGUAGE
2. Regenerate APPSTORE/ from VALIDATORS
3. Regenerate DOMAIN/ from specifications
4. Regenerate .github/ and .transcripts/
```

The system rebuilds itself.

---

## Why It Matters

```
Traditional system:
├── Backups
├── Disaster recovery
├── Hope nothing corrupts
└── Pray the backups work

CANONIC:
├── Keep LANGUAGE
├── Keep VALIDATORS
└── Regenerate everything else
```

Structural resilience, not backup resilience.

---

## The Minimum

What's actually essential?

```
LANGUAGE:
├── Three axioms
├── DETROS primitives
├── Grammar rules
└── Compliance definitions

VALIDATORS:
├── Triad checker
├── Inheritance checker
├── Introspection checker
└── VaaS implementations
```

Everything else derives.

---

## The Insight

Most of what we store is derivable.

The fixed point is smaller than you think.

Governance that can regenerate is governance that can't be lost.
