## The Typo

December 29, 2025. Managing a book project.

I create a file: `CANNON.md`

Double-N. A typo.

---

## The Fix

I correct it: `CANON.md`

That's it. The language is born.

---

## The Pattern

```
CANNON → CANON
   │
   └── Drift detected, fixed

001 → 00
   │
   └── Drift detected, fixed

Adding axiom → Blocked
   │
   └── Drift detected, prevented
```

Same pattern. Every time.

---

## The Recursion

CANONIC was born from evolutionary fixation.

The origin story IS the pattern:
- Error occurs
- Error detected
- Error corrected
- Constraint added
- Future errors prevented

---

## Index-First

The book spine came before the chapters.

`book_spine.md` defined:
- Part contracts
- Red lines
- Exit beliefs

Structure before content. Index before archive.

The spine committed the author to a path.

---

## The Insight

CANONIC doesn't just enforce fixation.

CANONIC IS fixation.

The first file was a corrected error. The language is the correction.
