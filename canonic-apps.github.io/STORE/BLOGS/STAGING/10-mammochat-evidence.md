**Markets:** v0 (MACHINE Era)
**Ledger:** Grant 354, Clinical trials

## The Theory

CANONIC governs organizations.

Nice theory. Does it work?

---

## The Evidence

```
MammoChat:
├── 20,000+ patient encounters
├── FCIF Grant 354 ($1.9M)
├── UCF Lake Nona development
├── AdventHealth partnership
├── Clinical trials: NCT06604078, NCT07214883
```

Real patients. Real healthcare. Real governance.

---

## What It Proves

```
CANONIC can constrain:
├── Patient interactions
├── Clinical decision support
├── Evidence generation
├── Compliance tracking
└── At scale
```

Not a toy. Production system.

---

## The Timeline

```
2017: Bloomberg Summit (origin)
2017-2024: $5M+ NIH/UCSF
2024: FCIF Grant 354
2025: Clinical trials begin
2026: CANONIC formalized
```

The system that became CANONIC was already working.

---

## The Insight

CANONIC wasn't invented then applied.

It was discovered by observing what worked.

20,000 patients taught us governance.
