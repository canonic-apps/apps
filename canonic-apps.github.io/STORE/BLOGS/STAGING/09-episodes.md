# Episodes as Evidence

*The canonical record of human-AI collaboration*

---

**Markets:** v0 (MACHINE Era)
**Ledger:** TRANSCRIPTverse (ep001-ep150+)

## The Problem

How do you prove a discovery happened?

- Memory fades
- Notes get lost
- Conversations vanish
- "I thought of it first" battles

---

## Episodes

Every human-AI interaction is an episode.

```
ep001: First conversation
ep042: Key insight
ep120: Invention moment
...
```

Timestamped. Indexed. Citable.

---

## The Properties

```
EPISODE:
├── Timestamp (when)
├── Participants (who)
├── Content (what)
├── Hash (immutable)
└── Index (findable)
```

Each episode is evidence.

---

## Citing Episodes

In a paper:

```
"The compiler correspondence emerged during ep042,
when the triad pattern became apparent (ep038)."
```

Reader can verify. Check the ledger. See exactly what happened.

---

## Invention Disclosure

```
IDF-001 references: ep120, ep038, ep006, ep040

Examiner can verify:
├── What was discussed
├── When it happened
├── Who was involved
└── What was contributed
```

AI-assisted invention becomes auditable.

---

## The Insight

Collaboration isn't just work. It's evidence.

Record it. Index it. Cite it.

The TRANSCRIPTverse is the ledger of discovery.
