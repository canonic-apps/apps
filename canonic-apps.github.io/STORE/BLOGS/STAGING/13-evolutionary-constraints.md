# Evolutionary Constraints of the CANONVERSE

## The Drift

I numbered a file `001`.

CANONIC uses `00` for origin.

Drift. Looks reasonable. Violates convention.

---

## The Wrong Fix

```
Manual rename:
001-origin.md → 00-origin.md

Problems:
├── Doesn't prevent next drift
├── No enforcement
└── Relies on memory
```

Manual fixes don't evolve.

---

## The Right Fix

Fix the law. Prose evolves to match.

```
CANON (constraint):
"ORIGIN is 00. SEQUENCE starts at 01."

Then:
├── WRITING validates
├── INTROSPECTION catches violations
└── System evolves
```

---

## The Biology

```
GENOME          CANONVERSE
   │                │
DNA             CANON + VOCAB
   │                │
constraints     constraints
   │                │
selection       INTROSPECTION
   │                │
fixation        evolution
```

Same pattern. Different substrate.

---

## CANON vs VOCAB

```
CANON = constraints (what MUST be true)
VOCAB = definitions (what words MEAN)

CANON references VOCAB terms.
VOCAB terms must satisfy CANON.

They constrain each other.
```

---

## Fixation

In biology: a mutation becomes universal in population.

In CANONVERSE: a constraint becomes enforced in all artifacts.

```
1. Drift happens (001 instead of 00)
2. Violation detected (INTROSPECTION)
3. Constraint added to CANON
4. All future artifacts comply
5. Fixation complete
```

---

## The Tension

```
LAW (CANON/VOCAB) ←→ PROSE (artifacts)
```

Law evolves slowly. Prose evolves fast.

The tension is productive. Law constrains prose. Prose reveals gaps in law.

---

## The Lesson

Don't fix artifacts. Fix constraints.

The genome doesn't repair individual cells. It encodes repair mechanisms.

CANON doesn't rename files. It encodes what files must be.
