# COIN — CANON

inherits: /MED/

---

## Axiom

**WORK = COIN.**

---

## Operators

```
MAX — add (earn)
MIN — sub (spend)
```

---

## Structure

```
(H, M, σ, τ)

H = hash
M = meta
σ = sig
τ = time
```

---

## Flow

```
WORK → MAX → COIN → LEDGER
              ↓
             MIN
              ↓
            WORK
```

---

## Constraints

1. WORK = COIN.
2. MAX needs WORK.
3. MIN needs COIN.
4. COIN → LEDGER.
