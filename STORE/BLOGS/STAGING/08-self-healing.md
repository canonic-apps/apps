# How CANONIC Heals Itself

## The Problem

Governance drifts. Rules get broken. Nobody notices until it's too late.

Traditional fix: audits, compliance checks, external review.

Expensive. Late. Reactive.

---

## Self-Healing

```
1. Extract rules from CANON
2. Scan artifacts against rules
3. Generate violations list
4. Attempt repair
5. Check authority
6. Execute if authorized
7. Log to LEDGER
8. Re-scan to verify
```

The system audits itself. Continuously.

---

## Authority Boundaries

Not everything auto-repairs.

```
AUTO-REPAIR:
├── Missing files
├── Format violations
├── Reference errors
└── Template drift

HUMAN REQUIRED:
├── Axiom changes (never)
├── Authority escalation
├── Constitutional matters
└── Non-resolvable conflicts
```

---

## Meta-Circular

The healing mechanism is itself governed.

```
INTROSPECTION governs INTROSPECTION

Self-healing rules live in CANON.
CANON validates self-healing.
Self-healing validates CANON.
```

Circular by design. That's the point.

---

## The Insight

Governance that can't check itself isn't governance.

INTROSPECTION isn't a feature. It's an axiom.

The third axiom makes the first two enforceable.
