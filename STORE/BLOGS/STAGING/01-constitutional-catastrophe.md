# When Adding Axioms Becomes Constitutional Crisis

*The most sensitive signal in governance*

## The Mistake

An AI assistant tries to be helpful:

```
CANONIC PRIMITIVES
├── TRIAD
├── INHERITANCE
├── INTROSPECTION
└── WRITING (VaaS)    ← WRONG
```

Four primitives. Looks reasonable. Helpful even.

It's constitutional catastrophe.

---

## Why It's Catastrophic

CANONIC is frozen. Three axioms. January 23, 2026.

```
CANONIC (pure)
├── TRIAD
├── INHERITANCE
└── INTROSPECTION

That's it. Closed. Forever.
```

WRITING is a LANGUAGE primitive. Different layer. Adding it to CANONIC violates the constitution.

---

## Why It Happens

This is the hardest signal to detect:

- LLM doesn't understand closure
- Human thinks they're "improving"
- Gradual drift over time
- Good intentions

It feels helpful. It's catastrophic.

---

## Why INTROSPECTION Exists

The system validates itself.

```
INTROSPECTION caught:
├── Attempted axiom addition
├── Layer boundary violation
├── Constitutional drift
└── Triggered correction
```

The constitution doesn't need improvement. It needs protection.

---

## The Hierarchy

```
CANONIC (frozen)
    │
    └── 3 axioms. Never changes.

LANGUAGE (primitives)
    │
    └── WRITING, DETROS, etc. Evolves.
```

Different layers. Different rules. Don't mix.

---

## The Lesson

Governance catastrophe doesn't look like catastrophe. It looks like improvement.

The most dangerous bugs are features.
