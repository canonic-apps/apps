## The Disease

AI slop:
- Hallucinated facts
- Inconsistent outputs
- Ungoverned generation
- "Trust me bro" evidence

Everyone's building AI. Nobody's governing it.

---

## The Cure

```
Compiler theory. 1970s.

Invalid programs don't compile.
Invalid governance doesn't validate.
```

The cure was always there. We just didn't apply it.

---

## The Correspondence

```
φ: GOVERNANCE → COMPILATION

φ(Triad)         = Syntax
φ(Inheritance)   = Scope Resolution
φ(Introspection) = Type System
```

Governance IS compilation.

## The Timeline

```
Day 1:  Compiler insight
Day 10: SOFT BIG BANG
Day 21: Three axioms frozen
```

21 days from insight to closure.

---

## The Insight

AI slop isn't a generation problem. It's a validation problem.

Compilers solved this in 1970.

We finally applied it to governance.
