## The Problem

Governance needs to express:
- What you claim
- How you prove it
- When it happened
- Where it applies
- How it executes
- What it is

Six questions. No framework.

---

## DETROS

```
D — Declarative   (what you claim)
E — Evidential    (how you prove)
T — Temporal      (when it happened)
R — Relational    (where it applies)
O — Operational   (how it executes)
S — Structural    (what it is)
```

Six dimensions. Complete coverage.

---

## The Lattice

Each dimension is binary: present or absent.

```
2^6 = 64 possible combinations

63 meaningful (at least one dimension)
 1 empty (no dimensions)
```

63 governance expression types.

---

## Case Semantics

```
UPPERCASE = governance
lowercase = governed

CANON.md  → governs
readme.md → governed
```

Case carries meaning.

---

## Examples

```
D only:       Claim without evidence
D + E:        Proven claim
D + E + T:    Time-bounded proven claim
D + E + T + R + O + S:  Complete governance artifact
```

---

## The Insight

Governance isn't freeform text. It's dimensional.

Every governance document maps to DETROS coordinates.

Incomplete coverage = incomplete governance.
