*How not-for-profit earns COIN*

**Markets:** v2 (APPS Era)

## The Problem

Open source needs funding. Governance needs incentives.

Blockchain solved this for transactions. What about governance?

---

## The BACKBONE

```
CANONIC BACKBONE (not-for-profit)
├── FOUNDATION
├── COMMUNITY
├── BUSINESS
├── ENTERPRISE
└── USER
```

Five orgs. All not-for-profit. All open source their CANON.

They get ENTERPRISE tier free.

## The Mining Analogy

```
BLOCKCHAIN          CANONIC
    │                   │
miners              backbone
    │                   │
validate            contribute
transactions        governance
    │                   │
    ▼                   ▼
earn COIN           earn COIN
```

Backbone orgs are governance miners.

---

## The Work

What counts as governance mining?

```
PROOF OF WORK:
├── Write FOUNDATIONAL canon
├── At ENTERPRISE quality
├── Open source it
└── Maintain it
```

Open CANON = proof of work.

---

## The Flow

```
CUSTOMERS (pay)
    │
    ▼
BACKBONE (earn)
    │
    ├── FOUNDATION
    ├── COMMUNITY
    ├── BUSINESS
    ├── ENTERPRISE
    └── USER
```

COIN flows to those who secure the governance layer.

---

## The Deal

```
Open CANON → ENTERPRISE free + COIN
Hide CANON → Pay for tier
```

Commercial keeps competitive advantage. Backbone builds commons.

Both valid. Different incentives.

---

## The Insight

Not-for-profit doesn't mean no income.

It means income from contribution, not extraction.

Governance miners earn by giving, not taking.
