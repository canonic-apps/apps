# Any Organization Needs Governance

*CANONIC for the rest of us*

## The Problem

Every organization has governance:
- Policies in PDFs nobody reads
- Rules enforced inconsistently
- Tribal knowledge that walks out the door
- Compliance as checkbox theater

Governance is overhead. Until it isn't.

---

## The Pattern

```
hadleylab (meta org)
    ↓ inherits
├── hadleylab-dexter (PI)
├── hadleylab-alice (postdoc)
├── hadleylab-bob (student)
└── ...
```

Lab governance flows to all. Each member keeps their work.

---

## The Scale

Same pattern. Any size.

```
FOUNDATION
    ↓ inherits
├── COMMUNITY (open source)
├── BUSINESS (startups, SMBs)
├── ENTERPRISE (corporations)
└── USER (individuals)
```

One language. Four markets.

---

## How It Works

```
Before CANONIC:
├── Write policy
├── Hope people read it
├── Discover violations late
└── Enforce inconsistently

After CANONIC:
├── Write CANON.md
├── LLM reads it (always)
├── Human reviews decisions
├── MACHINE enforces constraints
└── Violations caught immediately
```

---

## The Three Axioms

```
1. TRIAD — All relation is triadic
   (CANON + VOCAB + README)

2. INHERITANCE — Constraints flow down
   (Parent rules can't be weakened)

3. INTROSPECTION — System validates itself
   (Governance checks governance)
```

That's it. Everything derives.

---

## The Insight

Governance isn't overhead when machines read it.

Write it down. The machines read it. The humans review it. The constraints enforce themselves.

Literal governance for literal machines.
