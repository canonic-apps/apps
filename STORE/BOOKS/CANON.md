# BOOKS — CANON

inherits: /CANONIC/STORE/

status: active

## Axiom

**BOOKS = Constitutional writing. Published governance. Full DETROS.**

---

## DETROS Requirements

BOOKS require ALL six dimensions:

| Dimension | Required Element | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| D | SPINE.md | Declares conceptual order |
| E | REFERENCES/ | Proves all claims |
| T | ARC.md | Orders narrative progression |
| R | CHAPTERS/ | Bounds scope |
| O | EXERCISES/ | Enforces reader learning |
| S | SECTIONS | Shapes content form |

**BOOK = D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S = 63** (Full ENTERPRISE)

3. ARC monotonic
4. All chapters inherit correctly
5. VaaS passes at declared tier
