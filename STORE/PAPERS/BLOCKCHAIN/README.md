# BLOCKCHAIN PAPER (/papers/BLOCKCHAIN/)

A technical analysis of blockchain security separating cryptographic soundness from ecosystem vulnerability.

---

## Purpose

This paper resolves the debate between blockchain maximalists ("unhackable") and skeptics ("fundamentally broken") through layer analysis.

**Core thesis**: Blockchain cryptography (Layer 1) is unbroken. Blockchain systems (Layers 1-5) have lost tens of billions to exploits. The apparent contradiction resolves when layers are distinguished.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Five-layer security model
- Cryptographic foundation analysis
- Consensus mechanism security
- Historical exploit documentation (2014-2024)
- Attack vector taxonomy
- Quantitative loss analysis by layer

### Out of Scope

- Investment advice
- Specific token analysis
- Regulatory compliance
- Future price predictions

## Key Findings

| Layer | Security | Evidence |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 1. Cryptography | UNBROKEN | No SHA-256/ECDSA breaks |
| 2. Consensus | RARELY BROKEN | Few 51% attacks on major chains |
| 3. Bridges | FREQUENTLY BROKEN | $2.5B+ in bridge exploits |
| 4. Contracts | FREQUENTLY BROKEN | $8B+ in smart contract exploits |
| 5. Applications | CONSTANTLY BROKEN | $9B+ in exchange/wallet losses |

## Verdict

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| "Blockchain cryptography cannot be hacked" | TRUE |
| "Blockchain systems cannot be hacked" | FALSE |
| "The ledger holds the thief" | TRUE (records, doesn't recover) |
| "Blockchain is perfect" | FALSE |
