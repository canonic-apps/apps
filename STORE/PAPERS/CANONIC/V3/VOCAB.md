## Core Concepts

### DISTRIBUTED CANONIC

The trustless governance state where no single entity controls truth. Cryptographically anchored, multi-remote replicated.

### HARD BIG BANG

The expansion event when the canonverse becomes trustless. Transition from founder-controlled to cryptographically proven.

### multi-remote distribution

Replication across independent platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg) where consensus emerges from cryptographic proof.

### OpenTimestamps

Bitcoin blockchain anchoring protocol. Proves existence of content at a point in time.

### content addressing

Immutable reference by cryptographic hash. IPFS or equivalent. Content cannot be modified without changing address.

### real immutability

The property that history cannot be rewritten. Enforced by distributed consensus and cryptographic proof.

### v0.3 GATE

The three requirements that must pass for HARD BIG BANG: DISCLOSURE, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER, LANGUAGE SPEC.
