# V3 — SPEC

**BLOCKCHAIN Era**

**Freeze:** TBD (after v0.3 GATE passed)

---

## THE OUTCOME

**DISTRIBUTED CANONIC**

```
No single entity controls truth.
Governance is cryptographically proven.
The canonverse becomes trustless.
```

---

## COVERAGE (Past)

Internal closure. The complete linear map archived.

### The Linear Map (v0 → v1 → v2 → v3)

| Paper | Freeze | What Froze | IP Boundary | Status |
|-------|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **v0** | 2026-01-23 | Minimal kernel | Compiler correspondence | OPEN |
| **v1** | TBD | Complete governance | Governance paradigm | OPEN |
| **v2** | TBD | Distribution theory | VaaS + economics | CLOSED |
| **v3** | TBD | Trustless governance | DISTRIBUTED CANONIC | TRUSTLESS |

### Archive First

v3 archives everything before the HARD BIG BANG:

```
ARCHIVE FIRST:
  1. v0, v1, v2 → evidence vault
  2. All transcripts → immutable
  3. All provisionals → filed
  4. All claims → timestamped

THEN HARD BIG BANG.
```

---

## ROADMAP (Future)

External closure. The destination.

### The v0.3 GATE

Three requirements. All must pass. Then HARD BIG BANG.

| Gate | Requirement | What Archives |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| DISCLOSURE | Provisionals filed, arXiv published | IP claims |
| DISTRIBUTED LEDGER | Multi-remote, timestamps | Evidence |
| LANGUAGE SPEC | Can regenerate canonverse | The kernel |

### Opensource Boundaries (Final)

| Component | Status | IP Boundary |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| CANON axioms | OPEN | v0 freeze |
| LANGUAGE spec | OPEN | v1 freeze |
| Validators (source) | OPEN | v1 freeze |
| VaaS implementation | CLOSED | v2 freeze |
| APPS | CLOSED | v2 freeze |
| **DISTRIBUTED CANONIC** | **TRUSTLESS** | v3 freeze |

### After v3

```
v0.x = Private development (proof, priority, preparation)
v1.0 = Public launch (HARD BIG BANG)

THE CANONIC ERA BEGINS
```

---

## Closure

v3 proves: **Governance can be trustless.**

```
DISTRIBUTED CANONIC:
  - Multi-remote (GitHub + GitLab + Codeberg)
  - OpenTimestamps (Bitcoin anchoring)
  - Content addressing (IPFS)
  - Real immutability (history cannot be rewritten)
```

**Archive first. End with the code.**

**The canonverse becomes trustless.**
