# V3 — CANON

inherits: /WORK/PAPERS/CANONIC/V2/

---

## Axiom: DISTRIBUTED CANONIC

v3 MUST prove trustless governance through cryptographic anchoring.

---

## Depends On

v3 MUST NOT begin until:
- v2 is published
- v0.3 GATE is passed

---

## Core Claims

v3 MUST prove:

1. Multi-remote distribution is verifiable (consensus without trust)
2. Timestamps are cryptographic (Bitcoin anchoring)
3. Content addressing is immutable (IPFS or equivalent)
4. History cannot be rewritten (real immutability)

---

## v0.3 GATE

v3 MUST document passage of all three GATE requirements:

1. **DISCLOSURE COMPLETE** — Provisionals filed, arXiv published
2. **DISTRIBUTED LEDGER OPERATIONAL** — Multi-remote verified
3. **LANGUAGE SPEC PERFECT** — Can regenerate canonverse

---

## Evidence Boundary

All claims in v3 MUST trace to LEDGER evidence from BLOCKCHAIN era.
