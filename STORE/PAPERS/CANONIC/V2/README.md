# Paper v2: Distribution Theory

**Era:** APPS

**Evidence window:** Post FOUNDATION era

The distribution paper. Formalizes Validator-as-a-Service (VaaS) and governance portability.

---

## Core Contribution

```
VaaS = VALIDATORS + DISTRIBUTION + CERTIFICATION

Distribution Theory:
  - Validators as portable oracles
  - Governance as a service
  - Certification as trust anchor
  - APPSTORE as registry

If validation has value, validators should be compensated.
The coin follows from the axioms like a theorem follows from postulates.
```

Extends v1's governance paradigm into a distributable service.
