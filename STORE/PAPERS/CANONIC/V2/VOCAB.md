## Core Concepts

### VaaS

Validator-as-a-Service. Governance enforcement delivered as a portable oracle.

### portable validator

A validator that travels with the content it governs. Governance is location-independent.

### validator economics

The economic layer where validation has value. If validation is useful, validators should be compensated.

### certification

Third-party attestation of governance compliance. Trust anchor for external parties.

### federated distribution

Multi-remote replication where no single entity controls the canonical source.
