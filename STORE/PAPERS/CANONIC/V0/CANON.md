# V0 — CANON

inherits: /hadleylab-dexter/WORK/PAPERS/CANONIC/
series: *.md

**Version:** v0 (MACHINE Era Close)
**Archive:** github.com/canonic-machine

---

## Axioms

### 1. Compiler Correspondence

v0 MUST prove that governance is isomorphic to compilation.

The isomorphism φ: GOVERNANCE → COMPILATION maps:
- φ(Triad) = Syntax
- φ(Inheritance) = Scope Resolution
- φ(Introspection) = Type System

The mapping MUST be structure-preserving.

### 2. Evidence Boundary

**Paper freeze:** January 23, 2026

All claims in v0 MUST trace to LEDGER evidence from:
- Evidence window: December 29, 2025 — January 23, 2026
- Archive: github.com/canonic-machine (read-only)

---

### 3. Slop Inadmissibility

v0 MUST prove: AI slop is structurally inadmissible under CANONIC governance.

Slop cannot compile. The rejection is structural, not behavioral.

---

### 4. Version Continuity

v0 advertises v1 (Governance Paradigm).

Discussion MAY tease what's coming. Discussion MUST NOT specify v1 content.
