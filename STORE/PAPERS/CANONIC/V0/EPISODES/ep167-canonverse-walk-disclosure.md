## Discovery 1: Enforcer Pattern

**The *ING Enforcer Architecture**

Validators (DETROS) are consumed by *ING enforcers. The *ING modules are composite enforcement layers that consume atomic validators.

```
DETROS Validators (atomic)
         ↓
*ING Enforcers (composite)
         ↓
Domain Artifacts
```

- **WRITING** enforces .md (consumes CANON, produces validated markdown)
- **PUBLISHING** enforces .pdf (consumes .md, produces validated PDF)
- **DISTRIBUTING** enforces feedback (consumes .pdf, produces signals)

The *ING suffix denotes Python-optimized enforcement tooling.

---

## Discovery 2: Cybernetic Loop

**Signal → Operation → Artifact → Feedback**

```
Signal (CANON declares intent)
    ↓
Operation (*ING transforms)
    ↓
Artifact (.md, .pdf produced)
    ↓
Feedback (DISTRIBUTING validates signal)
    ↓
Signal (next iteration)
```

**Feedback after artifacts is the killer feature.**

DISTRIBUTING IS the feedback mechanism. It closes the loop by:
- Distributing to channels (arXiv, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Tracking signals back (citations, comments, stars)
- Validating that artifacts match original signal

## Discovery 3: Tree Scaling Validation as a Service

**Modular VaaS Architecture**

```
Root validators (DETROS: D, E, T, R, O, S)
         ↓
Composite enforcers (*ING)
         ↓
Domain artifacts (PAPER, etc.)
```

Tree scaling is efficient because:
1. Validators are reusable (atomic checks)
2. Enforcers compose validators (composite enforcement)
3. Domains inherit and extend (tree structure)

## Discovery 4: Intellectual Property Protection Chain

**Complete IP Safety**

```
Walk transcripts (episodes) → find discoveries
         ↓
Walk git ledger → find evidence commits
         ↓
Guarantee disclosure → every insight captured
         ↓
Layered provisionals → complete patent coverage
```

The IP validator composes DETROS:
- D (Declarative): Every invention has form
- E (Evidential): Every claim traces to commit
- T (Temporal): Evidence window bounded
- R (Relational): Inheritance chain to provisional
- O (Operational): Validators enforce disclosure
- S (Structural): Pattern recognition in transcripts

---

## Discovery 5: WRITING Architecture

**WRITING Consumes CANON**

```
PAPER/CANON → WRITING (rebalance) → .md → PUBLISHING → .pdf
```

WRITING does NOT hardcode requirements. WRITING reads requirements FROM CANON. CANON is the source of truth.

WRITING rebalances:
- Maximum/minimum narrative specification for business
- Closure for enterprise compliance

---

## Discovery 6: Lifecycle Grammar

**Noun Forms for States**

```
DISCOVERY → PROVISIONAL → PUBLICATION → DISTRIBUTION → repeat
```

The lifecycle uses noun forms for states. The *ING suffix is reserved for Python enforcer modules (writing.py, publishing.py, distributing.py).

---

## Discovery 7: Enterprise Compliance

**Canonbase Optimization**

- 85/85 governed scopes WRITING compliant
- PAPER v0 full *ING chain compliant
- 100% IP protection coverage

The *ING chain is operational across the enterprise.
