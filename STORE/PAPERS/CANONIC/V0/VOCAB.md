## Core Concepts

### CANON

The law. The first CANON.md was created for the *Dividends & Deaths* book project. The double-N was a typo—CANNON—but the insight was not. We realized: this is compilation. The typo was corrected. CANNON became CANON. The framework was born. CANON.md is the governance specification of a scope—what MUST be. Every governed scope contains exactly one. Every CANON.md declares its parent. Inheritance chains terminate at root. CANON is snapshot governance—the law at a point in time. Together with SPEC (the story—past and future), CANON achieves closure. 121 scopes now carry CANON.md files.

### compiler correspondence

The isomorphism φ: Governance → Compilation where Triad ≅ Syntax, Inheritance ≅ Scope Resolution, Introspection ≅ Type System.

### AI slop

Low-quality, machine-generated content that sounds authoritative but means nothing. Oxford word of the year 2025. CANONIC makes AI slop structurally inadmissible.

### structurally inadmissible

Content that cannot pass validation. Not filtered—rejected before entry. Invalid programs don't compile; invalid content doesn't validate.

### evidence window

The temporal boundary within which claims are valid. v0 window: December 29, 2025 — January 23, 2026.

### paper freeze

The IP boundary. Content after freeze belongs to next version.

### MACHINE era

The genesis era. December 29, 2025 — January 23, 2026. Three axioms. 26 days. Closure.

## The Three Axioms

### Triad

Axiom 0. A governed scope MUST contain CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md.

### Inheritance

Axiom 1. Every CANON.md MUST declare its parent. Chains terminate at root.

### Introspection

Axiom 2. VOCAB.md MUST define every concept in CANON.md and itself.

---

### DISTRIBUTING

Publication lifecycle state. After PUBLISH, DISTRIBUTING is the cybernetic loop feedback.

### DISCOVER

Lifecycle state. Exploration phase before PROVISION.

### PROVISION

Lifecycle state. After DISCOVER, PROVISION stakes claims with evidence window.

### COMPILER

A program that transforms source code into executable form. Invalid source doesn't compile.

### FOUNDATION

The era following MACHINE. v1 establishes the complete governance paradigm.

### AI

Artificial Intelligence. The subject of slop that CANONIC makes structurally inadmissible.

### VOCAB

Vocabulary specification. VOCAB.md defines every term used in governance.

### IP

Intellectual Property. Each version freeze establishes an IP boundary.

### LINEAR

As in "linear map" - the progression v0 → v1 → v2 → v3.

### PATENT

Legal protection. Provisional patents convert to non-provisional through the paper series.

### MACHINE

The genesis era. MACHINE ERA: December 29, 2025 — January 23, 2026.

### SCOPE

A governed directory containing the triad (CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md).

### AXIOM

A foundational rule from which governance derives. Three axioms: Triad, Inheritance, Introspection.

### VERSION

A frozen release. Each version (v0, v1, v2, v3) establishes an IP boundary.

### PAPER

The academic publication. PAPER series: v0 → v1 → v2 → v3.

### SPEC

Specification. The story—past and future. SPEC closes CANON.

### SYNTAX

Compiler concept. Structure must exist. Triad ≅ Syntax.

### FREEZE

IP boundary. Content after freeze belongs to next version.

### OS

Operating System. The triad pattern compiled into infrastructure.

### README

Human documentation. README.md describes what the scope is.

### CLOSURE

Completeness. Vocabulary closure, governance closure, evidence closure.

### PUBLISH

Lifecycle state. Release to arXiv.

### DISTRIBUTE

Lifecycle state. Feedback to LinkedIn, social channels.

### CANONIC

The framework. Constitutional AI governance through compiler correspondence.

### AXIOMS

Plural of AXIOM. The three axioms: Triad, Inheritance, Introspection.

### DISCLOSURE

Transparency section. Model, window, validation status.

### GOVERNANCE

Rule-based control. CANONIC governance through compiler correspondence.

### DESC

Description. Abbreviation for README purpose.

### DISTRIBUTED

Decentralized. DISTRIBUTED CANONIC is the v3 goal.

### LEDGER

The immutable record. Git is the ledger machine. Every commit is validation. Every push is proof.

### COMPILATION

The transformation from source to executable. Invalid source doesn't compile. CANONIC applies this principle to governance.

### SEMANTICS

What terms mean. VOCAB.md provides semantic closure.

### PATTERN

A recurring structure. The ledger pattern emerged from 17 years of data tracking.

### MD

Markdown file extension. The triad files are .md format.
