## Core Contribution

```
GOVERNANCE = CANON + VOCAB + README
          + INHERITANCE + INTROSPECTION
          + VALIDATION

Constitutional governance is:
  - Declarative (what, not how)
  - Hierarchical (inheritance chains)
  - Self-defining (vocabulary closure)
  - Machine-enforceable (validators)
```

Extends v0's compiler correspondence into a complete governance theory.
