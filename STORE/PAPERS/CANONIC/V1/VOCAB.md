# V1 — VOCAB

inherits: /paper/v0/

---

## Core Concepts

### constitutional governance

Governance expressed as constraints (what), not procedures (how). Declarative specification of valid states.

### monotonic inheritance

Property that downstream scopes cannot contradict or weaken upstream constraints. Inheritance only adds, never removes.

### vocabulary closure

The property that all terms used in CANON and VOCAB are defined within the scope or inherited from parent.

### mechanical validation

Enforcement of governance rules by automated validators. No human judgment required for validity determination.
