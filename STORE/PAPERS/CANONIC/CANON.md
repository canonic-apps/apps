# PAPER — CANON

inherits: /CANONIC/
series: *.md

**Version:** v0 (MACHINE Era Close)
**Archive:** github.com/canonic-machine

## Genesis

It started with a question asked for 17 years.

2007: GenomicPython (PhD thesis)—a ledger for biological data. Every change tracked.

2017: MammoChat (20,000 patients)—every clinical decision logged. When AI failed, the ledger told us where.

2025-12: Watching AI fabricate citations, the insight crystallized:

**The problem isn't AI. The problem is that AI output isn't compiled.**

Three axioms. 26 days. Closure.

## The Compiler Correspondence

GOVERNANCE ≅ COMPILATION

The isomorphism φ: G → C maps:
- φ(Triad) = Syntax
- φ(Inheritance) = Scope Resolution
- φ(Introspection) = Type System

The mapping is structure-preserving.

---

## Axioms

**Axiom 0 — Triad:** A governed scope MUST contain CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md.

**Axiom 1 — Inheritance:** Every CANON.md MUST declare its parent. Chains terminate at root.

**Axiom 2 — Introspection:** VOCAB.md MUST define every concept in CANON.md and itself.

## Publication Lifecycle

DISCOVERY → PROVISIONAL → PUBLICATION → DISTRIBUTION → repeat

Each paper proves its predecessor. Each paper advertises its successor.

---

## Manuscript Requirements

A valid manuscript.md MUST contain:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Abstract | State evidence window + core theorem |
| Genesis | Tell the origin story |
| Axioms | State the three axioms |
| Correspondence | Prove the isomorphism |
| Evidence | Declare temporal bounds + metrics |
| Disclosure | Model, window, validation status |

---

## Claim Validation

Every claim MUST:
1. Use terms defined in VOCAB.md
2. Trace to evidence in LEDGER
3. Be verifiable via supplemental

---

## Supplemental Separation

Main paper MUST NOT contain supplemental.
GitHub IS the supplemental archive.
The OS proves the paper.
