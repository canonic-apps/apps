## Core Concepts

### PAPER

A governed academic manuscript that codifies epistemic claims bounded by LEDGER evidence.

### SPEC

The temporal narrative that speaks CANON into existence. SPEC tells the story: where we came from (COVERAGE), where we are (TRIAD), how we want it to evolve (ROADMAP). TRIAD is snapshot; SPEC is temporal.

### CANONVERSE

The universe of governed scopes. Emerges from the narrative defined by SPEC.

### DETROS

The six orthogonal governance dimensions: Declarative, Evidential, Temporal, Relational, Operational, Structural. Forms a 2⁶ = 64-point lattice.

### compiler correspondence

The isomorphism φ: Governance → Compilation where Triad ≅ Syntax, Inheritance ≅ Scope Resolution, Introspection ≅ Type System.

### AI slop

Low-quality, machine-generated content that sounds authoritative but means nothing. Oxford word of the year 2025. CANONIC makes AI slop structurally inadmissible.

### BIGBANG

Expansion event in the CANONVERSE. SOFT BIGBANG is founder-controlled. HARD BIGBANG is public blockchain anchoring.

### COVERAGE

Internal closure. Documents where we came from. Past.

### ROADMAP

External closure. Documents how we want CANON to evolve. Future.

### epistemic

Relating to knowledge and justified belief. PAPER is epistemic-only: it records knowledge but does not govern behavior.

### epistemic-only

The constraint that PAPER records knowledge but does not govern behavior. Papers inform; CANON governs.

### evidence-bounded

The constraint that all claims in PAPER must trace to verifiable LEDGER evidence.

### ledger authority

LEDGER as the authoritative source for all evidence claims. PAPER cites; LEDGER proves.

### govern

To enforce normative rules. PAPER MUST NOT govern; it only records.

### claim

An assertion made in PAPER that MUST trace to LEDGER evidence.

### evidence

Verifiable data stored in LEDGER that supports PAPER claims.

### evidence window

The temporal and logical boundary within which claims are valid.

## Freeze Sequence

### freeze sequence

The three-phase immutability progression: IP freeze → publish freeze → ledger freeze.

### IP freeze

The first freeze marking the public/private boundary. Content remains editable.

### publish freeze

The second freeze when PAPER submits to external archive. Content becomes locked.

### ledger freeze

The final freeze when PAPER is versioned and immutable on chain.

### mutable

State before publish freeze where content can be modified.

### invariant

State after publish freeze where content cannot be modified.

---

## Supplemental

### supplemental

Material that supports PAPER but resides outside the main manuscript.

### supplemental separation

The architectural constraint that supplemental materials exist separately from manuscript. Supplemental proves; manuscript claims.

### Appendix

Supplemental containing math proofs and formal derivations.

### GitHub

The OS that serves as the supplemental archive. GitHub proves PAPER.
