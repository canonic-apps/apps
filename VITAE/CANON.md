# VITAE — CANON

inherits: /CANONIC/
series: VITAE.md
tier: 39

---

## Axiom

**VITAE = Evidence-linked living document. Claims MUST have proof.**

---

## Formula

```
VITAE = CLAIMS + EVIDENCE + LEDGER
```

---

## Axioms

- VITAE MUST be living. Updates as evidence accumulates.
- Claims MUST link to evidence. No orphan claims.
- Evidence MUST be auditable. Links to GitHub, DOI, PMID, transcripts.
- Snapshots MUST be immutable. Point-in-time versions anchored to LEDGER.
- Each VITAE MUST be unique. Person-specific.
- Non-profit VITAE MUST have ENTERPRISE tier by default.

---

## Constraints

- Scope: USER repos (e.g., hadleylab-dexter/VITAE/).
- Artifacts: VITAE.md (source) → VITAE.pdf (export).
- Level: BUSINESS (ENTERPRISE for non-profit/academic).
- AGENT: CHAT + EVO required for each VITAE.
