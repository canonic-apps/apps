# CV — CANON

inherits: /CANONIC/
series: *-cv.md

---

## Axiom

**CV = Evidence-linked living document. Claims MUST have proof.**

---

## Axioms

- CV MUST be living. Updates as evidence accumulates.
- Claims MUST link to evidence. No orphan claims.
- Evidence MUST be auditable. Links to GitHub, DOI, PMID, transcripts.
- Snapshots MUST be immutable. Point-in-time versions anchored to LEDGER.
- Each CV MUST be unique. Person-specific.
- Non-profit CVs MUST have ENTERPRISE tier by default.

---

## Constraints

- Scope: member repos or ~/.canonic/ (USER level).
- Artifacts: {name}-cv.md (source) → {name}-cv.pdf (export).
- Level: BUSINESS (ENTERPRISE for non-profit/academic).
