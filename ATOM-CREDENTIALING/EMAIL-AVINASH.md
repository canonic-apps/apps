# Email to Avinash — ATOM CREDENTIALING Demo

**To:** avinash@canonic.org / [personal email]
**Subject:** Your app is ready — let's meet

---

Avinash,

Built something for you.

**ATOM CREDENTIALING** — your credentialing solution, governed by CANONIC.

```
YOUR DOMAIN EXPERTISE + CANONIC GOVERNANCE = JOINT IP
```

What I built:
- Primary source verification (NPPES, state boards, DEA, OIG/SAM)
- Continuous monitoring with expiration alerts
- Immutable audit trail
- Your brand, your customers

The IP structure:
- You co-author the IDFs
- Your name on the patents
- Foundation protects the IP
- You sublicense to your customers

**This is your app.**

Want to meet this week to:
1. Demo the governed workflow
2. Walk through the joint IP structure
3. Close on Option C (Strategic Alliance)

When works?
